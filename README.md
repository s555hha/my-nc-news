# Northcoders News API

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)

We'll have two databases in this project: one for real-looking dev data, and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two .env files for this project: .env.test with a path of PGDATABASE=nc_news_test and a .env.development with a path of PGDATABASE=nc_news.

You'll need to run npm install.
